- 👋 Hi, I’m @JRFunding
- 👀 I’m interested in solving innovation/idea generation with capital funding. By creating a decentralized platform that connects ideas with any suitable capital. Extracting intermediaries and creating investable opportunities for non-institutional grade investors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about DAO governence and how to efficently allow capital and ideas to flow in a safe and more streamlined way. By connecting suitable ideas to suitable capital investors, albeit non-profits, for-profits, cooperatives, donation campaigns, or any idea that requires funding. A network accessible to any, but without the susceptible risks of embezzlement or inefficient capital spending. Within the governance of Vality are unique voting rights and transaction approvals that allow for investors and donors alike to be involved in the idea's successful rollout and progress. It is crowdfunding but for the decentralized web, allowing true investment potential and innovation/idea sharing without infringement of borders, political relationship, or censorship. Creating a capital market that will drive innovation and prospective wealth opportunities for any individual with a viable idea.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the governance and capital escrow methods necessary for properly safegaurding invested and donated capital. Code that restricts transactions exceeding prescribed amounts by entrepreneurs or management teams in their stated prospectus. A multi-utility token with native nft's that are ideas, each generated idea is a unique nft, similar to protectable IP. Giving the idea creator a means to protect their idea by expressing ownership of that idea. 
- 📫 How to reach me If you have interest in collaborating on this project please email (nathan.d.david12@GMAIL.COM) P.S. This is the future of innovation and capital funding. A globalized model that eliminates censorship and incentivizes global development. The old capital model is to reliant on centralized powers taking products and services to market, and suffocating smaller innovators, creating a status quo that hinders innovation.
